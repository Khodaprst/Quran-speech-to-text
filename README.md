Hello, My name is amir and am new in NLP.
My first task as an intern in this field, was processing Qur'an verses to spill it with the highest accuracy.
After 2 weeks of searching, I found the whisper model from hugging face(huggingface.co).

## importing libraries:
you need to install this libraries:
pip install whisper
note: this library isn't exist for anaconda so don't try: conda install whisper
pip install glob
pip install pydub
pip install sys
pip install os

after that, in which model of whisper library from hugging face, depending on the model you choose, you need to download the model.
